Robot: The Wife’s Attorney

## September 4
Today we began constructing the base of the robot. We cut a 35 × 40 cm wooden board to serve as the foundation, and then removed 12 × 12 cm triangular sections from each of the four corners. This created a more dynamic shape and reduced weight, while still keeping the structure stable. The base will support the wheels, battery, and motion system later on.

## September 9
Today we attached the front caster wheel to the base. We positioned it near the center of the front edge to keep the robot balanced and to ensure stable movement once the motors are added to the back. This was the first step toward defining how the robot will move in performance.

## September 10
We attached the two drive motors to the sides of the base and mounted the side wheels. The motors were positioned symmetrically so that the robot can move forward and turn smoothly. 

## September 18
We installed the 12V battery onto the base and mounted the Arduino and H-bridge motor driver. After securing each component, we wired the motors to the H-bridge and connected the power supply lines to ensure the system could deliver enough current for movement. 

## September 25
We wrote and uploaded a basic test code to the Arduino to check that the motors were working correctly. The program simply drove the robot forward and backward to confirm that the wiring and H-bridge connections were correct. This test was important to make sure the motors responded smoothly before moving on to more complex motion control and performance behaviors.

## September 27
We attached the radio receiver to the robot and paired it with the remote control. After wiring the receiver signals to the Arduino, we wrote code that mapped the joystick controls to the motors. This allowed us to steer the robot and move it forward and backward in real time. This was the moment the robot became fully mobile under direct control, which is essential for developing its performance behavior later on.

## October 2
We built a raised platform on top of the main base to begin forming the body structure of the robot. On top of this platform, we attached a cardboard cylinder to act as the central body column. This cylinder will serve as the core around which we will build the robot’s form, gestures, and visual character.
